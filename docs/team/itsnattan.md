### Project: Flashlingo

FlashLingo is a desktop application to facilitate the learning of new languages through flashcards. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: UI "yes" and "no" buttons
  * What it does: Invoke the yes and no command upon clicking
  * Justification: Makes it slightly more convenient for users who prefer a GUI interaction 
  * Highlights:
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=itsNatTan&breakdown=false)

* **Project management**:
  * Watched deadlines, ensured that internal deadlines were met so that progress was smooth.
  * Kept a close watch on code quality, ensuring that proper coding standards were adhered to.
  * Interacted closely with TA and Prof to make sure that certain things are allowed and that we are doing things right.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Changed the UI to accept FlashCards instead of People (Adapted to our project)
  * Added critical functionality to the UI to make things work

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Created the UGDraft.md file, and added the documentation for the help, exit, save, load functions.
    * Create the Table of Content, and the notation for command. 
    * Ensured that all command formats followed the proper standardised notation for ease of use.
    * Update Quick Start section to accommodate less technologically savvy users as well as a section on how to use the application.
    * Ensured all hyperlinks work as intended.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Created User Stories section.
    * Added some extensions to Use Case section.
    * Created sequence diagrams for the UI buttons
    * Change some UML diagrams to adapt to our current program

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  * Ensuring coding standard is followed
  * Managing the GitHub repository
  * Issue creation and assignment
