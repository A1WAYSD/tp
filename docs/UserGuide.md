--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `delete <INDEX>`, index is a parameter which needs to be added to the command, without the <>. `delete 1` is an example of the usage.

* Words in square brackets, ie. `[<UPPER_CASE>]` indicate that the parameter is optional and can be omitted if deemed unnecessary
  e.g. in `add w/<WORD> t/<TRANSLATION> [wl/WORD_LANGUAGE] [tl/TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE]`, the `WORD` and `TRANSLATION` parameters are *MANDATORY*, whereas the `WORD_LANGUAGE` and `TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE` do not need to be in the command.
  For example, both `add w/entschuldigung wl/Deutsch t/sorry tl/English` and `add w/regarder t/look` are valid usage of the command

* If the parameters have ... as a suffix, ie. `<UPPER_CASE...>`, it means that it can take multiple parameters that are comma separated.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
